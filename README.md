# Convolutional Neural Network-based Trend Following Strategy for Stock Market Trading
We proposed algorithmic stock trading using combination of CNN and Trend Following strategy

STEP#1:
        Experimental data is 5 index stock
	DJIA.csv
	NASDAQ.csv
	NSEI.csv
	RUT.csv
	SnP.csv

	First, execute the file trainCNN.ipynb, it will output afterDJIA.csv

STEP#2: Secondly, execute DTF.ipynb, it a code for trading strategy using CNN as classifier.
	It provides performance of the proposed system

STEP#3: Now, we will compare our method with simple CNN, TF based methods.
        Execute CNN.ipynb, TF.ipynb

STEp#4: Finally, to plots comparision of all methods execute final_djia.ipynb
